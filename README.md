This project introduces data encryption with AWS KMS to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access. Youâ€™ll learn how encryption works using digital keys and practice by:

- Creating encryption keys in AWS KMS

- Encrypting a DynamoDB database

- Adding/retrieving data to test encryption

- Seeing how AWS blocks unauthorized access

- Granting users encryption access
